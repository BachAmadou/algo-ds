# Data Structure and Algorithms Notes

### What is a Data Structure
Data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

It is important to know what the data structure is used for and when to use them.

### Why Data Structure (DS)
They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data. 

They make code cleaner and easier to understand

### Abstraction Data Type
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
