# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

### What is a Data Structure
Data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

It is important to know what the data structure is used for and when to use them.

### Why Data Structure (DS)
They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data. 
They make code cleaner and easier to understand

### Abstraction Data Type
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Computational Complexity Analysis
### Complexity Analysis
As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same
questionis over and over again:

How much **Time** does this algorithm need to finish?

How much **Space** does this algorithm need for its computation?

### Big-O Notation
Bigo-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the **worst** case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes **arbitrarily large**

It helps you write better code and becomes important as your inputs get bigger (e.g users posts for an app).

### What does **Better** implementation mean?
"Better" means **faster time** to finish and to use **less memory (RAM)**, although there is a much stronger emphasis on the former.

Here is a cheatsheet at for identifying runtime complexity at glance
